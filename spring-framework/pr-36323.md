## 🎯 Contribution Overview

### Problem
The Transaction Management documentation only provided XML configuration examples, making it difficult for developers using modern Java Config approach to find relevant examples.

### Solution
Added Java Config examples using tabs alongside existing XML examples:
- `@EnableTransactionManagement` configuration example
- `PlatformTransactionManager` Bean setup
- Side-by-side comparison of XML vs Java Config

### Changed Files
- `framework-docs/modules/ROOT/pages/data-access/transaction/declarative/annotations.adoc`
- 38 changes: 32 additions & 6 deletions

---

## 📅 Timeline

- **2026-02-12**: Issue discovery, expressed interest ("I can help with this")
- **2026-02-13**: Analyzed codebase, implemented changes, submitted PR

---

## ✅ What Went Well

### 1. Quick Decision and Execution
- Completed PR within 24 hours of maintainer response
- "Don't wait, just start" approach

### 2. Thorough Research
```bash
# Investigated existing tab patterns
grep -r "\[tabs\]" framework-docs/
```
- Analyzed tab usage in other documentation
- Studied Spring style guide
- Learned commit message patterns

### 3. Accurately Understood Maintainer Intent
- ❌ "Replace XML with Java Config"
- ✅ "Keep XML + Add Java Config tabs"
- Correctly reflected sbrannen's "tabs side-by-side" comment

### 4. Standards Compliance
- **DCO Sign-off**: Used `git commit -s`
- **Commit Message**: Followed Spring pattern exactly
  ```
  Transaction docs: add Java Config tab for @Transactional

  Closes gh-34093
  ```
- **PR Description**: Clear structure with Description and Changes list

### 5. Minimal Changes
- Exactly what was needed (1 file, 38 changes)
- Avoided over-engineering
- Didn't touch other files

---

## 🤔 Areas for Improvement

### 1. Initial Unnecessary Attributes
**Mistake:**
```asciidoc
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
```

**Fixed:**
```asciidoc
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
```

**Lesson**: Should have researched existing patterns more thoroughly

---

### 2. Too Verbose Initial Commit Message
**First Draft:**
```
docs: Add Java Config example for @Transactional

Add Java Config tab alongside existing XML configuration
in the @Transactional annotations section to demonstrate
modern annotation-driven transaction management setup.

Closes gh-34093
```

**Final:**
```
Transaction docs: add Java Config tab for @Transactional

Closes gh-34093
```

**Lesson**:
- Spring prefers brevity
- Check `git log` first
- Use "Area:" pattern for documentation

---

### 3. Could Have Prepared Other Files
**Missed Opportunity:**
- Could have worked on `first-example.adoc` simultaneously
- Could have made a larger contribution

**Strategy Adjustment:**
- Draft PR to confirm direction → Additional work
- Step-by-step approach is also valid

## 🎓 What I Learned

### Technical Learning

#### 1. AsciiDoc Tab Syntax
```asciidoc
[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
// Java code
----

XML::
+
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<!-- XML code -->
----
======
```

#### 2. Spring Documentation Structure
- `framework-docs/modules/ROOT/pages/` organization
- Transaction docs separation (`declarative/`, `programmatic/`)
- Meaning of `subs="verbatim,quotes"`

#### 3. DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin)
- Using DCO instead of CLA (since January 2025)
- `git commit -s` for automatic Sign-off
- Required for all commits

---

### Open Source Contribution Process

#### 1. "Show, Don't Ask" Principle
```
❌ "Can I do this?"
✅ (Build it first) "I did this, what do you think?"
```

#### 2. Importance of Quick Execution
- Waiting after comment means someone else takes it
- **First Come, First Served** culture
- Use Draft PR to claim territory

#### 3. Understanding Maintainer Intent
- Not just the **comment**, but the **context**
- "tabs side-by-side" → Don't delete XML
- "@sdeleuze opinion?" → Might need to wait

---

### Collaboration & Communication

#### 1. Concise Communication
- PR description: Clear structure (Description, Changes)
- Remove unnecessary explanations
- Let results speak

#### 2. Value of Standards Compliance
- Commit message patterns
- Branch naming
- Code style
→ **Reduces review time**

---

## 🎯 To Apply Next Time

### Immediate Application

1. **Research Existing Patterns First**
   ```bash
   # Commit messages
   git log --oneline --grep="docs:" -20

   # Code patterns
   grep -r "pattern" .
   ```

2. **Actively Use Draft PRs**
   - Confirm direction
   - Claim territory
   - Get quick feedback

3. **Contribute in Small Units**
   - 1 PR = 1 purpose
   - Incremental improvements
   - Reduce review burden

---

### Strategy Improvements

#### 1. Parallel Work
```
Spring PR #36323 (awaiting review)
    ↓ (simultaneously)
MyBatis #1967 (analysis & testing)
```

#### 2. Time Allocation
- **Research**: 30% (pattern analysis, reading docs)
- **Execution**: 50% (coding, testing)
- **Cleanup**: 20% (commit messages, PR description)

#### 3. Feedback Response
- **Within 24 hours** reflection goal
- **Clear questions** (answerable with Yes/No)
- **Provide alternatives** (Option A, Option B)

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

### 1. Quick Execution > Perfect Planning
```
"Start now and get feedback via Draft PR"
```

### 2. Follow Existing Patterns > Creative Attempts
```
"Project's way, not my way"
```

### 3. Start Small > Contribute Big
```
"1 file, 38 lines is valuable enough"
```

### 4. Clear Communication > Verbose Explanation
```
"Save maintainer's time"
```

### 5. Show with Results > Explain Intent
```
"Show, Don't Ask"
```
